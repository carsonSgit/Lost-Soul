# Lost Soul


In the JavaScript game Lost Soul, you play as a brave protagonist clearing out monsters from a dark cave to protect nearby villagers. Armed with nothing but a sword, navigate treacherous terrain, 
defeat foes, and face the ultimate challengeâ€”the Fire Demon, in a climactic battle for the realm's peace. Lost Soul invites players to become the hero villagers need in the player's adventure.
